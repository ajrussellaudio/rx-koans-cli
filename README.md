# Rx Koans on the Command Line

This repo contains a set of broken tests that you have to fix. As you go
through the examples, it should help you learn some of the important features
of [RxJs][rx]. There is already an older version of Rx koans that uses a web
testing tool, but I wanted one for the command line. Also, at the time of
writing, the other version uses an old version of Rx.

Usage:

    npm test

This will run mocha tests and watch for file changes. You should get the tests
to pass by replacing `________` with the correct values. Once all the tests are
passing, you win absolutely nothing, except for a bunch of grey dots and
greater mental prowess.

## Answers

Checkout the `answers` branch for passing tests or see the `answers/README.md`
file for the answer key.
