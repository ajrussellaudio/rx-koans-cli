If you've dropped in from Google, this repo is for my answers to the koans. All the tests are passing and you won't have any fun.

# Rx 5 Koans on the Command Line

Koans == learn by example

This repo contains a set of broken tests you have to fix. As you go through the
examples, it should help you learn some of the important features of [RxJs][rx] 5.

Usage:

    npm install
    npm test # or `npm watch`
    npm test -- lessons/1.spec.js

This will run jest tests and watch for file changes. You should get the tests
to pass by replacing `________` with the correct values. Once all the tests are
passing, you win absolutely nothing, except for a bunch of `PASS`es and greater
mental prowess.

## Answers

Checkout the `answers` branch for passing tests.
