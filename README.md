# Rx Koans on the Command Line

This repo contains a set of broken tests that you have to fix. As you go
through the example, it should help you learn the various features of RxJs.
There is already an older version of Rx koans that uses a web testing tool, but
I wanted one for the command line. Also, at the time of writing, the other
version uses an old version of Rx.

Usage:

    npm test
