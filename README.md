# Rx Koans on the Command Line

![npm dependencies](https://david-dm.org/jondlm/rx-koans-cli.svg)

Koans == learn by example

This repo contains a set of broken tests you have to fix. As you go through the
examples, it should help you learn some of the important features of
[RxJs][rx]. There is already an [older version][old] of Rx koans that uses a
web testing tool; I wanted one for the command line. Also, at the time of
writing, it is using an outdated version of Rx.

Usage:

    npm install
    npm test

This will run mocha tests and watch for file changes. You should get the tests
to pass by replacing `________` with the correct values. Once all the tests are
passing, you win absolutely nothing, except for a bunch of grey dots and
greater mental prowess.

## Answers

Checkout the `answers` branch for passing tests or see the `answers/README.md`
file for the answer key.
